# Retail Banking Analytics Report

This project explores retail banking data to understand customer activity,
branch performance, and key operational trends. The goal is to review the
patterns that matter most in day-to-day banking work, such as transaction
volumes, customer groups, product usage, and simple efficiency indicators.

The project is inspired by my past experience working in the banking sector,
where most decisions depend on clear reporting and practical insights rather
than complicated models. This analysis focuses on the type of information a
branch or district office would want to see on a regular basis.
