# Data Information

This folder contains a 50,000-row sample of the original retail banking transaction dataset. 
The full dataset is more than 25MB, so this sample is used for analysis in this project.

The sample keeps the same columns and structure as the original data:
- TransactionID  
- CustomerID  
- CustomerDOB  
- CustGender  
- CustLocation  
- CustAccountBalance  
- TransactionDate  
- TransactionTime  
- TransactionAmount (INR)

The sample is large enough to perform meaningful analysis while staying within GitHub’s file size limits.
